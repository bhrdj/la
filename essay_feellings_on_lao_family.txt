when to use ແມ່ນ, when to use ເປັນ?

My wife's mother's family is a Lao family. I feel like they are very helpful and caring.

ຄອບຄົວຂອງແມ່ລ້ຽງຂ້ອຍເປັນຄອບຄົວລາວ.ຮູ້ສຶກວ່າເປັນຄົນຢ່າງມັກຊ່ວຍ ແລະ ຢ່າງມີຮັກແພງ.

But, there is a dispute among my some of my wife's mother's Lao siblings. There are two sides, and they do not talk to each other.

ແຕ່ວ່າ  ບາງອ້າຍເອື້ອຍນ້ອງຂອງແມ່ລ້ຽງມີການຜິດຖຽງກັນ. ມີສອງຂ້າງ. ລາຍບີແລ້ວ,ບໍ່ໃດ້ຢາມກັນບໍ່ໃດ້ລົມກັນ.

While they are all welcoming to us, we have to try to be fair to the different groups.

ເຖິງແມ່ນວ່າ ເຂົາເຈົ້າຕ້ອນຮັບພວກເຮົາລາຍ,

They are also very helpful. They are so helpful that it becomes inconvenient sometimes.

This first month in Laos has been rather peaceful. But I think this peaceful time is over now. My wife's mother is coming this afternoon, and I think we may soon be very busy on the weekends visiting with family.
